All the files found in this folder were created by Diana Smith (aka cyanharlow)

https://diana-adrianne.com/

I copied files from the following repos:

https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-character
https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-francine
https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-gaze
https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-lace
https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-pink
https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-vignes
https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-zigario

My random css colorizer program dynamically downloads the css and html files required to display the artwork, and I did not want to hotlink from Diana's website, so I put copies here.

I stripped out the non-essential files, and commented out her Google Analytics code so as not to mess with her stats.
