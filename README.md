# CSS Randomizer

This is a program I wrote after being inspired by the CSS artwork created by Diana Smith https://github.com/cyanharlow

I wanted to see what her artwork would look like if I altered the colors of each element to be a random color. I've always had a love for randomness. When I was a kid learning to code, I would write programs to generate various patterns of random colors. This was back in the days of 256 color VGA. It was a lot of fun.

I wrote a series of functions that perform different color transformations. You can find these in the file `demos.js`

I apologize for the messy code, it was written in my (very little) spare time. I was all hacking, I did very little actual planning. If you have questions about how it works, please do your own analysis, but feel free to contact me if you get stuck. I'm not a super-javascript wizard (as far as I know, if you think otherwise, please offer me a job).

# Potential Modifications

I would love to see what others come up with based on my idea. I don't know a lot about CSS, and one feature I'd like to see added to this program is some sort of transition effect, where upon each iteration of random color reassignment, there would be a gradual fade between the old and new color assignments.
